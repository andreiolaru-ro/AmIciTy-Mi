READ ALL OF THIS FILE. IT'S ONLY ONE PAGE.

1. **FIRST RULE** 
 Use comments. All comments, strings, and identifiers should be written in American English. Spellcheck your comments and strings (see Eclipse settings). 

2. NAMING AND DOCUMENTING
 For classes and class members (functions or objects) use JavaDoc [1]. A quick tutorial here [2] or just search Google.
 Also, respect the the Java Naming Conventions [5]: lower case package names, upper CamelCase class/interface names, lower CamelCase method/field names, upper case constant names. 
 
3. FORMATTING
 Learn to use the automatic formatter in Eclipse so that you can quickly reformat the source according to your preferences.
 Don't mind if other people's sources are formatted differently, just reformat it as you want. 
 Conversely, write only code that can be autoformatted by Eclipse. Don't manually remove whitespace or blank lines. 

4. COMMITS
 Always comment when committing. Just say what small or big changes you have done. Spellcheck your comments.
 Add the comments to the information/changelog.txt file (you can use dokuwiki format), and to the commit message.
 It would be best if one commit should correspond to one bug / one issue / one thing to do.
 **DO NOT COMMIT:** host-specific files: .class files, binaries, Jade-generated files, etc  

5. LIBRARIES
 Do place all necessary libraries in the repository, in the /lib folder, so that in Eclipse's build path editor they are added with 'Add JAR' (not with 'Add External JAR').
 In fact, the rule of thumb is no external JARs. 

6. **UPDATE BEFORE COMMIT**
 Always update/fetch+pull before commit/push. (useful views in Eclipse are Synchronize and History) 

7. CONSTANTS
 If you define a constant (anything that is a fixed string, number, etc) define it in a single place across all sources,
  as high (i.e. towards the beginning of the file) in the code as possible in the context where you define it (e.g. just after the class definition).
 Final constants are best. 

8. USE ENUMS
 Whenever you need to define types for something, use enums (see [3]). Not number constants, not string constants. 

9. WARNINGS AND TAGS
 Do resolve all warnings in your code. Warnings are just like errors, but they don't stop you from executing. They still must be solved.
 Learn to use // TODO: and // FIXME: They also appear in the Tasks view and in the scrollbar. Also, remove auto-completed TODOs once they are no more needed.
 In Eclipse, activate ALL warnings, except for "Unqualified access" and "Non-externalized strings" (also, "Forbidden access" is an error), and check all boxes, except for the last two.  

10. ACCESS QUALIFIERS
 Make appropriate use of public, protected and private (see [4]) - not all members should be public. Don't make member objects public. Also be careful with static and final.
